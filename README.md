# Paper Studio Code ✏️
Paper Studio Code is a revolutionary way to code! Forget typing on a keyboard—now you can write your code on paper and watch it come to life. This project brings together the best of analog creativity and the power of modern coding environments.

## How Does Paper Studio Code Work? 🤔
- Write code on paper.
- Scan your handwritten code on a website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Paper Studio Code uses Tesseract.js to recognize your handwritten code.
- The recognized code is sent to Gemini to detect the programming language.
- Gemini compiles the code, making it ready to execute.
- Get the result back from Paper Studio Code after processing.
